<h1>Are you NEW???</h1>
<p>Don't panic if you are new to our community, you will be able to feel like home after you read through this. First, SIGNUP, this is one of the most improtant step, if you do not have an account, you will not be able to access a lot of pages, as well as easily connect to our commmunity.</p>
<p>To signup, just click on the members menu on the right hand side.

You may ask why do we need your real name? We need it in order to address you correctly and formally in the email addresses we send to you, however, they will not be used for any other purposes. Be sure to enter your correct email account, so when you lose or forget your password, we can send them to you.</p>

That email should include your password, so leave that email in your inbox would ensure you do not forget your password.</p>
<p>After login, you should see a user navigation bar, (blue) at the top, the menu is clearly labeled, so that you dont get lost, and can easily flip through the pages. Guestbook and Blog layout is easily customizable to your own preference, and new entries, edit entries should also be fairly easy.</p>
<p>The message system and photo manager should be userfriendly, the search page enables you to find members that you already know, and are also in our community as well. Be free to use the categorize search to make your life easier.</p>
