<h3>History</h3>
<p>This site was started by one person's idea. The original idea was to build a new and revolutionary site that can exceed the popularity of the existing social networking sites. We strongly felt that it is important to make this service 100% free, because by charging users, a limitation on the variety and number of users registering would inevitably be constructed. This idea was then developed and improved by few technology people. These people came together and put the ideas into practical, and the site you see now is the good proof of it. They spent their time and energy trying to provide users the best service they can. The site was launched at Febuary of 2007, and since then, we had being able to continously attract visitors and supporting members.</p>
