It looks quite capable to me just needs some minor fixing.;seDpNL#I'd be happy to help your site grow, well I had my own website a rpg(role playing game) php,mysql,java based which i released on 29th december of 2006 and it became really popular received 500+ members the first week and 1598 in the first month. It was going great and I decided to take it down for a while and upgrade to version 2 but than my uncle passed away and I had to leave it in the middle. But now I'm back and am at the point of finishing with tons more things for people to do and I'll be happy to link to your site maybe I can like add awards for people who sign up here from my site but yeah we can talk about that. you can read the forums for some suggestions I posted or check your pm on phpfreaks.
